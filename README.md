Events in Next.js work similarly to React, using handlers like onClick, onChange, and onSubmit.

Event handlers are written as functions and passed directly to JSX elements.

Functions handle logic such as API calls, form submission, and conditional rendering.

Both inline functions and reusable named functions are supported.

State is managed using React hooks like useState and useReducer.

State enables dynamic UI updates without page reloads.

Next.js supports client-side state in components marked with "use client".

Proper state management improves performance and user interaction.

Events, functions, and state together create interactive and responsive Next.js applications.
